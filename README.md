## Description
> This project was to modify starter code and create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an ```Express.js```  back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end was already created. It's was my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
